# MachineLearning
Project Based on Machine Learning..
This repository just a begining of my learning. Maybe be the files are conjusted, but the work is not. I hope this my first very step into a realistic project world.

1. Iris CLassification(DataSet is Provided): First checkout the code for Jupyter notebook. By this you will make a model to classify the class of the flower.Then go to vs code for creating a pickle file(Flask) to run the classification on web. A html file is used for web user interface and the model is connected with it to classify the class. Thus running the flask code, which is integreated with html and the notebook codes, thus provides you with the web link to classify the flower according to their length and width.       

2. Movie Recommendation system: Here you will find a lot of files, so may get confused which file represents which project. Files(app.py, app, main.py, movieRecmdSys.jpy, m.pkl, similarity.pkl,movie_list.pkl,movies.csv, .ipynb_checkpoints). The above given are the files required. First write the jupyter source file for classifying the movies. Second use the vs to write your main program, app and a pickle file for creating a interface for where we can get the recommendation of movies from. Pickle fiels are use to serialize and deserialize the files. It converts the objects in byte stream. By running the app program you will get the host link to run the program in web.
