# MachineLearning
Project Based on Machine Learning..
This repository just a begining of my learning. Maybe be the files are conjusted, but the work is not. I hope this my first very step into a realistic project world.

1. Iris CLassification(DataSet is Provided): First checkout the code for Jupyter notebook. By this you will make a model to classify the class of the flower.Then go to vs code for creating a pickle file(Flask) to run the classification on web. A html file is used for web user interface and the model is connected with it to classify the class. Thus running the flask code, which is integreated with html and the notebook codes, thus provides you with the web link to classify the flower according to their length and width.
